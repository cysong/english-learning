# An Unknown Goddess

## Summary writing

Archaeologists found clay fragments in the most sacred room of a temple on the Aegean island of Kea. The fragments belong to fifteen statues each of which represented a goddess, which had been painted. The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. and its missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. The archaeologists reconstructed the fragments and were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. However her identity is sill unknown.
