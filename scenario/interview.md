# Interview

* Tell me a little bit about yourself.

I've always loved designing and building things, so I suppose it's natural that I became a engineer. I have worked in a variety of roles and companies, which I have learned a lot from, but now I'm ready for a new challenge.

I like to explore the principles behind how the world works, and I am good at it as well. I taught myself computer and software knowledge and won my  first job as a software tester. After a few years, I was not satisfied with testing software but building it myself, so I took the opportunity to  become a software development engineer. I enjoy studying new technology and building things that are useful. Now, I'm ready for a new challenge.

* Where do you see yourself five years from now?

I don’t know exactly, but the most important thing is that I continue to learn and grow in my career. I’m the kind of person who needs new challenges to stay focused. I might even start my own business, because that’s something I’ve always wanted to do at some point in my life.
