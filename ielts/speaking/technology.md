# Technology



## Which invention do you think will be the most popular in the near future?

There will likely be all kinds of artificial intelligence devices and applications. For example, every smartphone currently comes with a built-in virtual personal assistant, known as Siri on the iPhone. Users can ask Siri to make a phone call or tell them the weather with voice commands.

## Do you think inventions will control human one day?

I do believe that inventions will one day control human beings. A growing number of services and applications are powered by various artificial intelligence programs, which can decide what you see, what you eat, what you buy, and do much better than you would have done yourself. So there's no doubt that one day we're going to rely heavily on those programs and give up everything we have.

## Do you think entertainment will become home-based in the future?

Yes, I believe entertainment will become home-based in the future. This is happening with all the latest technologies. For example, with a TV and a camera, people can play motion sensing games so they don't need to go to the gym to exercise. With virtual reality you can meet a remote friend face to face or do an online sightseeing tour.

## What changes has technology brought to our lives?

The changes technology has brought can be seen in literally every aspect of our lives. In the past, when you ate you just ate, when you walked you just walked, but now you probably take out your mobile phone and immerse yourself in the screen, no matter what you are doing, even riding a bicycle. 

Technology has changed everything in our lives, especially in recent years. Cloud computing has greatly increased our efficiency and has improved coordination online. Development of rocket and communication technology is making satellite Internet a reality, allowing us to stay online wherever we are on Earth. Blockchain allows us to manage our personal assets without relying on any technology giants or centralized commercial banks.

## Does technology make people lazier?

Well, technology is not meant to make people lazier or lead lazier lifestyles. Its purpose is to increase our efficiency. A very recent example is face recognition technology, which has been used at some train stations and airports. Staff there no longer need to check the identity documents of every single passenger, which used to take about five minutes or longer.

## What are the impacts of Internet/computer on our life?

Apart from the benefits the Internet has brought to us, we should also take the negative influences seriouly. To be more specific, there are some security risks involved in using the Internet. If a hacker attacks your computer or other device, you may lose your money or even your privacy.

## What can we do to tackle cyber security issue?

Generally speaking, both companies and individuals should take measures to improve Internet security. For companies, it can improve system design, release more secure operating systems and software, and strengthen data transmission security; for individuals, develop good security habits. Do not run software from unknown sources, and do not visit questionable websites and emails.

## Will robots change our society greatly?

Well actually I think robots are changing our society greatly. Robotification is not something that will happen in the future; instead, it's already begun. Many jobs used to be done by humans are now taken by robots. For example, when shopping in a supermarket, many of us tend to use self-checkout, rather than go to the clerk.

## Would you ride in a car driven by a robot?

Of course, I would like to try driverless cars. I prefer a car driven by a program rather than a human driver who is easily distracted by a phone or something else, and hard to stay focused continuously on the car and its surroundings.
