# Interview



## Do you like interview?

I don't think there are manly people like interview. My heart beats faster at the thought of joining an interview. But in order to get a better job we have to confront and fully prepare for it. So I usually plan my upcoming interview carefully, for example, go to bed early to get enough sleep, double check the time and address, and arrive early to avoid any exception.
