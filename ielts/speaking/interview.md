# Interview



## Do you like interview?

I don't think there are manly people who like being interviewed. My heart beats faster at the thought of going to an interview. But in order to get a better job we have to confront it and be fully prepared for it. So I usually plan my upcoming interviews carefully, like going to bed early to get enough sleep, double checking the time and address, and arriving early to avoid any exceptions.
