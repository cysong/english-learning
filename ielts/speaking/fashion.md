## Describe a well-paid job you would like to have in the future.

I want to be a fashion buyer, who's job is picking apparel and accessories to be sold in retail stores. A buyer meet with various vendors and designers to look at clothing, shoes,and accessories to descide if they are the right fit for the store. Fashion buyer must be aware of the the store's budget,clothing quality and price. They need to be knowledgeable about fashion trends and styles as well.

I have been a sofeware engineer for many years, and I will continue to do so if there are no accidents in the future. Software engineer build everything running on computer,phone and any other computing platforms, such as your fridge,with code. A outstanding software engineer must be a master of coding language, and have a clear understanding of framework and details of the system

## Do you buy shoes that are comfortable or look nice?

Well,actually I don't think if I want to wear comfortable shoes, I have to sacrifice my style.I mean, once you learn how to mix&match different fashion items,like wearing a trench coat with sneakers, you can achieve a so-calaled effortless chic. stylish people don't necessarily have to wear high heels.

I have bean wearing sneakers all the time. I worked for a big tech company and everyone dresses casually, so, when I buy new shoes, comfortable and simple shoes are my favorite.

## Describe a person you know who dresses well/Do you know someone who is really fashionable?

Well, one of my idols, Dilraba has a great fashion sense.She's always well-dressed,but it's not that she dresses in every smart clothes. She never dresses to kill or anything like that.Actually she prefers casual clothes and she think it's possible to look good in white T-shirt and a pair of jeans. A couple of monthes ago ,she was invited to attend a fashion show and walked the runway. I think that was because her style was recognized by luxury fashion brands.
