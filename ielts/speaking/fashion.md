## Describe a well-paid job you would like to have in the future.

I want to be a fashion buyer, with a job picking apparel and accessories to sell in retail stores. A buyer meets with various vendors and designers to look at clothing, shoes, and accessories to decide if they are the right fit for the store. Fashion buyers must be aware of the store's budget, clothing quality and pricing before they can purchase a new item. They need to be knowledgeable about fashion trends and styles.

I have been a software engineer for many years, and I will continue to do so if there is a need for more software development. Software engineers build everything that's running on computers, phones and other computing platforms, such as your fridge, with code that is easy to read and understand. An outstanding software engineer must be a master of coding languages, and have a clear understanding of the framework and details of the system.

## Do you buy shoes that are comfortable or look nice?

Well, I don't think I have to sacrifice my style if I want to wear comfortable shoes. I mean, once you learn how to mix and match different fashion items, like wearing a trench coat with sneakers, you can achieve a so-called effortless chic. Stylish people don't necessarily have to wear high heels.

I wear sneakers all the time. I work for a big tech company and everyone dresses casually, so when I buy new shoes, comfortable and simple shoes are my favorite.

## Describe a person you know who dresses well/Do you know someone who is really fashionable?

Well, one of my idols, Dilraba has a great fashion sense. She's always well-dressed, but it's not as if she's dressed in any smart clothes. She never dresses to kill or anything like that. Actually she prefers casual clothing and thinks it's possible to look good in a white T-shirt and a pair of jeans. A couple of months ago ,she was invited to attend a fashion show and walked the runway. I think it was because her style was recognized by luxury fashion brands.
